wiz IRC plugin for JIRA (free software)

This is a simple plugin to notify an IRC channel whenever tasks in JIRA are updated.

You will need to set:

Settings -> Add-ons -> IRC Notifications
- IRC Server hostname
- IRC Server port
- IRC Server ssl

Settings -> Projects -> (Select Project) -> IRC Notifications
- IRC Channel

After changing the IRC server settings, a restart of JIRA may be required.

Development:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into JIRA and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
